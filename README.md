# VQE_Portfolio_Optimization

Optimising asset portfolios using a variational quantum eigensolver in a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm.

For an extensive description of the theory behind this project, see [THEORY.md](THEORY.md).

# Overview

Portfolio optimization is achieved by the formulation: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
This minimises a quadratic polynomial over binary variables.
PennyLane has a QUBO-to-Ising function that translates a QUBO optimisation problem into a molecular eigenvalue problem.
